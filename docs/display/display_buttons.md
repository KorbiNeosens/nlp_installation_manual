# Buttons Functionality

| **Button** | **Function** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **LINK**  | Pair the Display with an existing Truck Transceiver. **Press and hold** to enter the pairing screen. You should see the word "Accept", then click **SET** to initiate the automatic pairing process. Press **LINK** to exit. |
| **SET**   | Change the units in the display, **press once** to change between PSI/Bar and Celsius/Fahrenheit. |
| **CODE**  | Change the number of Trailers handled by the Display. This number should match the number of Trailers configured in the Truck Transceiver. **Press and hold** to enter the screen. Adjust the settings using **+/-** and press **LINK** to exit.  |
| **+/-**   | Navigate through the received wheels. |

The display will automatically navigate through all wheels. However, if there is any active warning in any wheel the display will just navigate through the wheels with warning. And the **+/-** buttons will also only navigate through the wheels with a warning condition.
